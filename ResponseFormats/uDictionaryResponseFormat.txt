  definition: 'An HBO show based on George R. R. Martin\'s books. The show\'s got a great deal of politics, royal intrigues, incest, murder, warfare, violence and sex. Mediæval genre and features lots of swordplay and riding horses. And a lot of violence and sex. Did I mention the sex? And drinking and a dwarf with an obsession with whoring.',
